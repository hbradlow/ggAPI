There are two levels to this library, the class that the user interacts with contained in main.py, and the lower
level where each game/distribution system has a custom scraper.

MAIN CLASS ARGUMENTS: 
-username 
-list of games 
-id * 
-realm * 
-service * 

The sublevel scrapers take the same arguments, and return the following: 

-A dictionary with key=game name, value=dictionary of that games stats
